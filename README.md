🐱 Cat-and-Dog Image Classifier
This repository contains my solution to the Cat and Dog Image Classifier project, completed as part of the freeCodeCamp Machine Learning curriculum. 
The objective of this project was to build a neural network model capable of classifying images as either cats or dogs using TensorFlow and Keras.

🧠 Model Summary
Architecture: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras

Dataset: Cats vs Dogs dataset from Microsoft (via TensorFlow Datasets)

Preprocessing: Image resizing, normalization, and data augmentation

Metrics: Accuracy, Loss

🚀 Features
Loads and preprocesses a real-world image dataset

Builds and trains a CNN for binary image classification

Uses data augmentation to improve model generalization

Evaluates performance on validation/test data

Includes plots of training vs validation accuracy/loss


💡 Make sure you have TensorFlow installed.

🏆 Project Goal
This was an assignment project for the freeCodeCamp Machine Learning certification. 
The main objective was to gain hands-on experience in image classification using convolutional neural networks.
